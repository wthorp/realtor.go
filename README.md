# realtor.com 

This is a tool was originally written to pull Realtor.com real estate listings into proper GIS programs.

As of 09/24, it no longer appears to function correctly, and has been archived.

When originally written [2/26/2019], the [Terms](https://marketing.move.com/terms-of-service/) link at [Realtor.com](https://www.realtor.com/) was broken.  I can only assume that they don't like their content being scraped / cached.
